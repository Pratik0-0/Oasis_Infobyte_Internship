        <div class="story">
            <p>On the freezing heights of Rezang La at 16,000 feet in Ladakh, 120 soldiers of the 13th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment (13 KUMAON), commanded by Major Shaitan Singh, wrote one of the most glorious chapters in military history. Facing over 5,000 Chinese troops in sub-zero temperatures, these brave hearts chose death over dishonor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite being heavily outnumbered and running out of ammunition, not a single soldier retreated. They fought till their last breath, with many found frozen in their battle positions, still clutching their rifles. The Chinese forces were so impressed by their valor that they left the post undisturbed as a mark of respect.</p>

            <h3>Major Shaitan Singh, PVC (Posthumous)</h3>
            <p>Major Shaitan Singh led his troops with exceptional courage and leadership. Despite being grievously wounded early in the battle, he refused to be evacuated and continued to direct his men. His last words were reportedly encouraging his troops to fight till the end. For his extraordinary valor, he was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration.</p>
